# Worker Queue Layer

Reference the DrawIo schematic found in `DesignDocuments/v0.0.0.drawio`.

This directory hosts the RabbitMQ message (work) broker as well as the code for each worker. 

Workers have a top level utils package they import to perform aggregation. All workers have connections to DB and cache. 

We use a Docker image of RabbitMQ for production ease and scale. Read more about using this [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/). 

# Setup and spin-up

First make sure you have docker installed on your machine. You can do so [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

## IMPORTANT DOCKER INFO
By default, __all external source IPs are allowed to connect to ports that have been published to the Docker host's addresses.__

This is __not an issue__ if you have __not port forwarded__ or __trust everyone on the network__ 

To allow only a specific IP or network to access the containers, insert a negated rule at the top of the DOCKER-USER filter chain. For example, the following rule drops packets from all IP addresses except __192.0.2.2/26__:

 `iptables -I DOCKER-USER -i ext_if ! -s 192.0.2.2/26 -j DROP`

### Local development

You will need to add localhost to the iptables if you secured your docker container with the steps above. 

You can do this via 
`iptables -I DOCKER-USER -i exit_if ! -s 127.0.0.1 -j DROP`


## RabbitMQ SpinUp

Navigate to the RabbitMQ server and run:

```bash
sudo docker run -d \
--memory={your_ammount}(b,k,m,g) \
--hostname hearysay_rabbit \
--name rabbit1 \ 
-p 5672:5672 \  # Maps containers port to hosts port
-p 15672:15672 \  # Management ui port
rabbitmq:3
```

You can check that the containers running by entering `sudo docker ps` where you should find:

`someID   rabbitmq:3   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦" ... 4369/tcp, 5671-5672/tcp, 15691-15692/tcp, 25672/tcp   rabbit1`

To veryify that the RabbitMQ server is working as inteded you can run `reciever/go run send.go` or `telnet localhost 5672`

RabbitMQ uses __Port 5672__ by default. You will need to allow this port in your UFW / IP tables for docker.

### Stopping / Deleting the container

`sudo docker ps` Finds the container list

`sudo docker stop rabbit1` Will only stop the container from executing code. It will __NOT__ remove it from your container list.

`sudo docker rm rabbit` Removes the container and allows you to start a new one. Ex: start new container with different memory parameters.
