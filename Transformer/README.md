# Transformer Time!

This directory will contain our custom transformer model. We will be using poetry again for dependency management across machines. I also expect us to "modularize / packageize" our code to keep best practices and prevent multi-line cmd commands just to spin this project up.

We will have two main packages, one using a __PyTorch Transformer__ and one being fully custom transformer __Vespera__.
